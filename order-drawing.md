##Portrait of face, animal or painted T-shirt##

- You have favorite celebrity, you love your family member or pet and wish nice drawing. 
- Or you're big fan of music band, movie, game and you would like to have original T-shirt that nobody has. 
- Or you know somebody who would be happy to get hand made gift.
- Maybe you have another idea of reason for this.

In all cases I can help you with choosing photography and then draw black &amp; white or colored portrait, design your own T-shirt and paint it. We will discuss right tools (pencils, charcoal, colored pencils).
Colors on T-shirt are permanent.

##Photography rocks!##
You have already chosen photo and size of the main object is large enough (approximately above 10cm x 14cm). Just [send it to me](art@pave.rocks) and we can start plan the art!

Beauty of face is photography itself. I like playing with shadows and lights. Good photography has a lot of emotions inside and I'm trying to catch them in my drawing. So if you can't decide which photo you should use, [email me](ask@pave.rocks), I can advice.

##Process of making##
I will send you photography during the process so you can have remarks. You will pay after finishing work when you will be satisfied with the result.

##Size, material##
You can choose among A5, A4 or A3 paper formats, your preferred type of paper and its color.

##You have thousands other questions##
You're not sure about anything and don't know exactly what you're searching but you love art and you wish to have something special. I can help you with your decision when you [email me](mailto:ask@pave.rocks)
