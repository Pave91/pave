##Who I am##

My name is Pavlína Ostrá and I present myself as Pave to remember better for everybody. I live in Prague, Czech Republic.


##Why I started to draw##
I started to draw faces when I was 15. Before that I was just drawing at school general things as everybody but I was never thinking about some drawing career or something. Till I started to be fascinated by mimics and people's faces. 

I was drawing my favourite musicians. Then I went to study university and it ate all of my time. Things changed and I returned to drawing when I graduated.
Nowadays I live like frontend developer but drawing makes me much happier.

I love music so that's main reason why I like drawing musicians but it isn't condition. I'm trying new styles, I'd love to paint nature - snow, rain, trees, sunset and so on. It's passion.

##Do you have special wish?##

If you like my work and you're thinking about something nice you would like to have drawn, just [write me](mailto:ask@pave.rocks), I believe we can find optimal style or expression for you or your friends.
